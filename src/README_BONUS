Bonus

    For implementing the bonus I used a FileReader for reading the orders byte by byte by each OrderManager thread.
    Each thread has an index and it computes a start and an end point for the byte range it will read. That computation
    is made that all the threads will have an equal quantity of data to read. After reading the data, if the start of
    the end are in the middle of a line, they are calibrated and all the data is put in a buffer then parsed into a map.
    If there are more threads than orders, some of them will finish executing and will no longer be used in this part
    of the program.
